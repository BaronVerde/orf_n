Here is my initial brainstorming for the forces that shape the surface of a solar system body. The goal is to identify parameters and find a naive algorithmic solution. I just post the initial thoughts, maybe (hopefully) it catches interest, maybe not.

--------------------

Simplifications: no plate tectonics, no hydro- or cryosphere, no atmosphere, no biosphere, or else this would lead too far too soon. Must have room to improve ;-)

Then i would assume:

- Mass and elemental composition determines shape and differenciation.

- Number of surface craters depends on time, though most form in the early phases of a solar system.
Bigger ones earlier, smaller ones later.

- Primordial heat, heat transport and radiation will lead to temperature and density differences ...

- ... leading to interior convection ...

- ... which can result in lava flows, burying surface features.

- When cooling and solidifying has given enough "structural integrity", volcanic edifices can arise ...

- ... or, depending on ?, plate tectonics can start.

- Uplift here must have subsidence there.

- Uplift equals crustal thinning, eventually tear, subsidence equals filling with sediments.

- Small impacts will erode and supply regolith, ...

- ... as will the accretion of dust and erosion through radiation and particle bombardment.

- Surface dust and small particles can be gravitationally transported, or spread by impacts.

- Ad- and co-hesion will define the slopes necessary for movement.

- While primordial heat leaves the body, the heat budget is more and more dominated by radiogenic heat and surface solar irradiation.
